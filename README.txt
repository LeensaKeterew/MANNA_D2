MANNA - IMY 220 Project, Deliverable 2
======================================

MANNA is a photo sharing website for recipes and the Bible verses that go with them.
This deliverable connects the React frontend to an Express API backed by MongoDB Atlas as required in the spec

Tech used
  - Frontend: React (Vite), React Router, TailwindCSS v3
  - Backend: Node.js + ExpressJS
  - Database: MongoDB Atlas, using the official "mongodb" package (no Mongoose)
  - Docker + Docker Compose for running everything

Folder structure
  /backend    Express API. db/ has one file per collection, services/ has the logic,
              routes/ has the Express routes, seed.js adds the starting data
  /frontend   React app. All data comes from the API using the native Fetch API
  docker-compose.yml, README.txt and .gitignore are in the root


HOW TO RUN (Docker)
-------------------
The database connection string is in backend/.env (included in my submission ZIP).
The .env is not on GitHub because it has my database password.

Commands I used, run from the project root (the folder with docker-compose.yml):

  docker compose up --build        builds the images and starts both containers
  docker compose down              stops and removes the containers
  docker compose down -v           same as above but also deletes the uploads volume
  docker compose restart backend   restarts the backend (this also re-runs the seed)
  docker compose exec backend node seed.js    runs the seed by hand

Once it says "Connected to MongoDB Atlas" in the terminal, the site is at:

  http://localhost:8080

The frontend runs in nginx on port 8080 and passes /api and /uploads on to the backend
container (port 3000). The Dockerfiles are in /backend and /frontend.

If the connection fails, the Atlas Network Access list needs to allow the computer
running Docker (I set it to 0.0.0.0/0).


DATABASE AND SEED DATA
----------------------
The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas and is already filled in. The backend also runs
a seed script every time the container starts. It only adds records that are missing, so
it never creates duplicates and it never overwrites changes that were made on the site.

Seeded data: 6 users (1 admin), 7 posts, 3 albums, friendships (one pending request),
comments, likes, hashtags, 6 report reasons, 1 open report and some messages.


LOGINS (username or email)
--------------------------
  Admin   manna_admin     admin@manna.test      Admin123!
  User    miriam_okafor   miriam@manna.test     Password123!
  User    david_mensah    david@manna.test      Password123!
  User    ruth_adeyemi    ruth@manna.test       Password123!
  User    samuel_obi      samuel@manna.test     Password123!
  User    esther_kimani   esther@manna.test     Password123!

miriam_okafor is the best one to test with. She is already friends with david_mensah
and ruth_adeyemi, and she has a pending friend request from esther_kimani on her profile.
Friends are needed for the local feed and for messaging.


WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED
-------------------
  - Sign up, log in and log out
  - View and edit your own profile, view other profiles, delete your account
  - Send, cancel, accept and decline friend requests, and unfriend
  - Create, edit and delete posts (image upload, description, hashtags)
  - Create, edit and delete albums, and add or remove posts in an album
  - View posts and albums, like and comment on posts, report posts
  - Local feed (me + my friends) and global feed (everyone)
  - Admin page: edit/delete users, posts, albums and comments, and add new report reasons
  - Extras: search, trending hashtags and messaging between friends

NOTES
-----
Styling: I used TailwindCSS with my own colours, fonts, border radius and shadow set up as
theme values in tailwind.config.js. Tailwind's default fonts are replaced with Playfair
Display (headings) and Nunito Sans (body), both installed through @fontsource, and inputs
and buttons use the same body font so no default browser fonts show up. Preflight is turned
off so my D1 layout stayed the same. No templates or component libraries were used.

Console errors: browsers log every 4xx/5xx fetch as a red console error, even when the app
handles it (for example a wrong password). To keep the console clean, my frontend sends the
header "X-Soft-Errors: 1", and then the API returns errors as HTTP 200 with
{ ok: false, message, status }. Requests without that header (Postman, curl) get the normal
4xx/5xx status codes.

Other:
  - Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs
  - Images that fail to load fall back to a local placeholder image
  - Uploaded images are saved in a Docker volume called manna_uploads
